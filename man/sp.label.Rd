\title{Label One or More Objects}
\usage{
sp.label(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single object or a list of objects to be labeled.}

\item{...}{The name(s) to assign to the object(s), typically unquoted.}
}
\value{
A named list. If \code{x} is a list, it is returned with names applied.
If \code{x} is a single object, it is wrapped in a named list.
}
\description{
Assigns names to objects, useful for labeling results before formatting or saving.
}
\details{
This function helps attach meaningful names to resultsâ€”either to a single object
(which is wrapped in a named list) or to a list of objects (which are directly named).
It uses non-standard evaluation to capture names from the call.
}
\examples{
# Label a single result
result <- list(Estimate = 0.5, SE = 0.1)
labeled <- sp.label(result, my_result)

# Label multiple results in a list
list_of_results <- list(
  list(Estimate = 0.5),
  list(Estimate = 0.7)
)
labeled_list <- sp.label(list_of_results, t1, t2)

}
