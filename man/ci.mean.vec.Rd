\title{Confidence Intervals for a Set of Means with vector input}
\usage{
ci.mean.vec(alpha, m, sd, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Significance level (e.g., 0.05 for a 95\\% confidence interval).}

\item{m}{A named numeric vector of sample means.}

\item{sd}{A numeric vector of sample standard deviations.}

\item{n}{A numeric vector of sample sizes (number of observations per group).}
}
\value{
A matrix with rows corresponding to group names (from \code{means}) and columns:
\describe{
\item{Estimate}{The sample mean.}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the mean.}
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom (n - 1).}
\item{LL}{Lower limit of the confidence interval.}
\item{UL}{Upper limit of the confidence interval.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the confidence interval for a vector of sample means given
standard deviations and sample sizes. Returns a matrix with the estimate,
standard error, degrees of freedom, and lower and upper limits of the
confidence interval.

# Named groups
ci.mean.vec(
  alpha = 0.05,
  m = c(A = 5.2, B = 6.1),
  sd = c(1.1, 1.3),
  n = c(30, 28)

# Unnamed groups: generic names will be assigned
ci.mean.vec(
  alpha = 0.05,
  m = c(5.2, 6.1),
  sd = c(1.1, 1.3),
  n = c(30, 28)
