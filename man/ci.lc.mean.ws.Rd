\title{Confidence Interval for a Linear Contrast of Means (Within-Subject)}
\usage{
ci.lc.mean.ws(alpha, m, s, R, n, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar. Significance level (e.g., 0.05 for 95\% CI).}

\item{m}{Numeric vector of length J. Means of the J conditions.}

\item{s}{Numeric vector of length J. Standard deviations of the J conditions.}

\item{R}{Either a scalar (average correlation among all condition pairs) or a J x J
correlation matrix among conditions.}

\item{n}{Integer scalar or vector of length J. Sample size (number of subjects).
If a vector is provided, all elements must be equal.}

\item{q}{Numeric vector of length J. Contrast weights.}
}
\value{
A 1-row matrix with named columns:
\describe{
\item{Estimate}{Linear contrast estimate \(\sum v_i m_i\).}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the contrast estimate.}
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom (n - 1).}
\item{LL}{Lower limit of the confidence interval.}
\item{UL}{Upper limit of the confidence interval.}
}
}
\description{
Computes a confidence interval for a linear contrast of means
from within-subject (repeated measures) data, accounting for the variance-covariance
structure given by standard deviations and either a correlation matrix or a single
average correlation value.
}
\details{
If \code{R} is a scalar, it is treated as the common correlation among all pairs of
conditions and is expanded into a J x J matrix with 1's on the diagonal and the
specified correlation on the off-diagonal. If a matrix is provided, it must be a
symmetric J x J correlation matrix.

The function computes the variance-covariance matrix \(V = D R D\), where \(D\)
is a diagonal matrix of standard deviations. The variance of the contrast is
calculated as \(v' V v / n\). The confidence interval is constructed using the
t-distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom. If \code{n} is a vector, all
values must be equal, and the common value will be used.
