\title{Extract Row or Column as Named Vector from Data Frame or Matrix}
\usage{
sp.extract(data, index)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or data frame from which to extract data.}

\item{index}{A character or numeric value specifying the row or column to extract.
If character, it is matched against row names first, then column names.
If numeric, it is interpreted as a row index first, then a column index.}
}
\value{
A named vector containing the extracted row or column values.
}
\description{
This function extracts a single row or column from a matrix or data frame
by name or index. It automatically detects whether the input corresponds to
a row or a column and returns the result as a named vector. The names are
preserved from the opposite dimension (column names for rows, row names for columns).
}
\examples{
input <- data.frame(
  m = c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3),
  sd = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  n = c(10, 20, 30),
  row.names = c("group1", "group2", "group3")
)

# Extract column "m" as named vector (names are row names)
sp.extract(input, "m")

# Extract row "group2" as named vector (names are column names)
sp.extract(input, "group2")

}
